This repository contains a Flutter application that fetches the latest news using an API and displays them in reverse chronological order, sorted by date. The application is designed to be responsive, catering to both mobile phones and desktops. It also includes additional features such as a search functionality, a splash screen with a fading animation, and custom-designed UI elements inspired by the reference design from [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/20160174-News-Portal-Mobile-App).

## Basic Requirements:

### 1. Responsive User Interface:
The application is built using Flutter to ensure a responsive user interface on both mobile phones. The UI layout will adapt to different screen sizes, providing a seamless user experience across devices.

### 2. Splash Screen:
The app includes a splash screen that features a fading animation. Upon launching the app, users will be greeted with this screen, which transitions smoothly to the application's home screen.

### 3. Loading Indicators, Retry, and Refresh Buttons:
Wherever necessary, the app will display loading indicators to inform users of ongoing data retrieval processes. In case of errors, the app will provide retry buttons to attempt data retrieval again, and refresh buttons to update the displayed news articles.

### 4. Minimal External Dependencies:
To ensure a clean and maintainable codebase, the application will prioritize minimal usage of external dependencies and packages. The code will be modularized for better organization and reusability.

### 5. Null-Safety and Error Handling:
The app will be developed using Flutter's null-safety feature to minimize potential null-related bugs. Proper error handling mechanisms will be implemented to provide a smooth user experience even in the face of unexpected errors.

### 6. Fetching News via API:
A new application will be created to fetch the latest news using an API. The news articles will be displayed in reverse chronological order, sorted by date, giving users easy access to the most recent information.

## Bonus Points:

### 1. Search Feature:
To enhance user convenience, the app will implement a search feature that allows users to find news articles based on specific keywords. This feature will provide a faster way to access relevant information.

### 2. Custom Splash Screen Animation:
In addition to the fading effect, the app will feature a custom-designed animation for the splash screen, drawing inspiration from the reference design found on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/20160174-News-Portal-Mobile-App).

### 3. Beautiful Custom-Designed UI Elements:
The application will incorporate beautiful custom-designed UI elements inspired by the reference design from [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/20160174-News-Portal-Mobile-App). These elements will add a visually appealing touch to the app's overall design.
